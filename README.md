This code is a simulator for general 1-dof spatial four-bar. The spatial joint types included in this code are: Revolute (R), Prismatic (P), Cylindrical (C), Universal (U), Spherical (S) joints and Welded (W) joint.
To simulate a four-bar, just change the input matrixs: JJ, JT, JA, JC to the topology you want to simulate. An example is given below:

For now, this simulator only support to put the actuator on R joint.
